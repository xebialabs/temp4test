<h1>Importable application package</h1>

<p>
A package is a version of an application that can be imported from the file system or URL. 
To be imported, the package should be in DAR format, or any format that can be imported by the custom importers that are installed on the XL Deploy Server.
</p>

<p>
When importing from the <code>importablePackages</code> directory on the XL Deploy Server, the package may also be stored as the unzipped DAR.
